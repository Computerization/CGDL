> 2D Game Developing Library for Computerization  

## CGDL  

### Purpose  

1. Create a convenient and useful tool for wfla game developers. "wfla game developers" not only refers to the programmers, but all the students who are willing to develop games.  
2. Computerization is planning to set up a competition of game developing in WFLA. This tool is planned to be served as the official tool of this competition.  
### Technical details  

- Language: Javascript  
- Compile TypeScript with
```shell
$ tsc
```
- Start the app with
```shell
$ npx serve
```

### Functions  

The functions for the nonprogrammers are not mentioned  

#### Functions that will be written in the prototype  

1. Multi-scene  
2. Action System for Game Characters  
3. Interactive System  
4. Particle Effects  
5. Geometric Figure and Text Management  
6. Music Management  

#### Functions that will defenitely appear in the future  

7. User Management  
8. Web-based Database  
9. Basic Textures  

#### Functions that may appear in the future

10. AI-npc System  
11. Physical Engine  
12. PVP Function  
13. Skinned Mesh  
#### Other Functions  

14.  Graphic Programming Interface  

## Details about the Competition

1. In the first competition, only Computerization members are allowed to attend. However, in the future, we are planned to allow all wflaers (including middle-school department) to attend the activity.  
2. Games should be designed using this library and the language of javascript unless we have finished the graphic programming interface or the adaption of other languages.  
3. Games should fit the theme given before the launch of the competition.  
4. Games are initially free. However, by paying a little amount of price (currently we allow the developers to set the price themselves), the players can enter the ranking list. The price the players pay are partially used as rewards for the top 1/10 (the proportion is undecided yet) players.  
6. 50% of the rest price are used as rewards for the top 3 (undecided yet) developers, 45% are used as the fund of computerization, 5% (undecided yet) are used as salaries to the organizers.  
7. To rate the developers, every player who pay the price are allowed to rate that game. In addition, some players who do not pay the price are randomly picked to rate that game. Their votes have the same weights. Finally, the average score will be the rating of that game.  
8. (undecided yet) The game will open every day from 5 p.m. to 2a.m.  
9. The way of paying is not decided yet.  
10. All competition programmes written by members in computerization should be uploaded on github and be open to all public after the competition.
